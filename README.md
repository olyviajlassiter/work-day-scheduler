# Module 5: Challenge 5: Create a Work Day Scheduler

This week's challenge allowed us to create a web application to generate a work day scheduler. The user is able to see current day and time, as well as save and load tasks from the scheduler saved from local storage. The user is able to differentiate the time by looking at the scheduler and understanding what the different colors mean in every hour. 

<b>User story is as follows:</b><br>
AS AN employee with a busy schedule<br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner<br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively<br>

<b>Acceptance criteria is as follows:</b><br>
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br>
WHEN I open the planner<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
WHEN I scroll down<br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours<br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day<br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
WHEN I click into a time block<br>
THEN I can enter an event<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
WHEN I refresh the page<br>
THEN the saved events persist<br>
